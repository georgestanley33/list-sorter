## Python List Sorter

### Simple program which takes a list input from the user, and sorts it using either:

- Bubble Sort
- Insertion Sort
- Selection Sort
- Quick Sort
- Merge Sort
- Python's inbuilt sorted() function

#### Allows the user to pick which algorithm to use. Asks for confirmation before sorting, displaying the list and method, and  then returns the sorted value using the specified algorithm.

### This tool can be used to observe:
- How correct each algorithm is
- How different algorithms process the same user defined list
- How custom implementations differ from Python's inbuilt sorted() function

## Updates:
- Timer now shown after each sort, allows you to visually compare each method
- Extra option, allows you to run all functions at once to easily compare the time of all of them.
